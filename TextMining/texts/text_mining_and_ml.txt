Text Mining and Machine Learning:
Machine learning or ML is a part of artificial intelligence (AI), that provides systems with the
ability to automatically learn from the experience without the need of explicit programming. ML
can help computers to solve complex non deterministic problems with speed and accuracy. ML
is also a part of artificial intelligence (AI) and is one of the most important parts of NLP and text
mining.
Machine learning for NLP and text mining involves using machine learning algorithms and
artificial intelligence to understand the meaning of text documents. The documents may be
anything that contains text, social media queries, online reviews, survey responses and even
financial, medical legal documents. ML in natural language processing and text analytics helps
to improve, accelerate and automate the underlying text analytics functions and NLP features
that convert the unstructured text into usable data and outcomes.
Machine learning in NLP and text analytics involves a set of statistical techniques that identifies
parts of speech, entities, sentiment and other parts of the text. The techniques can be
expressed as a model which is then applied to other texts i.e. also known as supervised
machine learning. Supervised learning algorithms such as Support vector machines, Bayesian
networks are used to build and improve core text analytics functions and NLP features. Another
learning method i.e. unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used in case of large sets ofdata. Unsupervised learning methods such as clustering are extremely useful for extracting the
NLP feature from large data sets.
