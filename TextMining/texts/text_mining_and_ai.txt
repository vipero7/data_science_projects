Text Mining and Artificial Intelligence:
Artificial Intelligence or AI is the ability of a machine to mimic the problem solving and decision
making capabilities of the human brain. Integrating AI in the text mining or text analytics can
lead to the development of broad applications such as competitive intelligence, human resource
management and market analysis. AI consists of different elements such as Machine learning
and Natural language processing. Both Natural language processing and Machine learning
plays an important role in enhancing AI systems. WIthout Natural language processing, AI can
only understand the meaning of language and answer simple questions, but it won’t be able to
know the actual meaning of the words. Thus Natural language processing in AI allows users to
communicate with a computer in natural language. Similarly without machine learning, AI can
only perform the defined tasks i.e. it can not perform non deterministic problems on it’s own.
AI with both Natural language processing (NLP) and Machine learning (ML) is used in text
mining thus helping us to find the valuable insights from large amounts of data. AI provides a
large set of real-world applications such as speech recognition, customer service, computer
vision, recommendation engine and many more. Thus having a large set of functionality, AI in
text mining is one of the most important aspects as it binds together useful methods such as
Natural language processing and Machine learning.
