Text Mining and Natural Language Processing:
Natural language processing or NLP helps machines to process and read text or speech by
simulating the human ability to understand natural language such as english. NLP is a part of
artificial intelligence (AI) and is concerned with giving computers the ability to understand
natural languages in the same way as human beings do.
NLP is used to understand the concepts within documents and helps to decipher ambiguities of
language to extract key facts and relationships and provides summaries. Text mining uses theapplications of NLP to derive the high quality of information from the text. Basically text mining is
the overall process of deriving useful information from the unstructured data and NLP is one of
the methods to do so. NLP combines computational linguistics i.e. rule based modeling of
human language with statistical, machine learning and deep learning models thus enabling
computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data to understand its full
meaning and complete the writer's intent and sentiment.
With the vast amount of data it is impossible for us to read all of the information ourselves and
identify whatâ€™s most important and it might take us forever to analyse ambiguous data. However
text mining with the help of NLP does all the process with accuracy and at high speed. NLP may
be part of text mining and artificial intelligence but it is not less in case of the applications. NLP
provides large use cases such as sentimental analysis, chatbot, speech recognition and
machine translation and hence making it one of the most important methods of this overall
information retrieval process.
